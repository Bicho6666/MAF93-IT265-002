#### Free Thinking
- I think the main stairs in the HCAD building can be built wider even though it was designed to be slim, no one likes to be interacting with other students
<!--

- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"
  
-->

#### Next Steps
- Tasks or experiments to focus on during the next session.
